# ContactsApp-BackEnd
In this project, I'm working with JAVA/EE and specially with :
- Spring Data Jpa
- Hibernate
- Spring Boot

you can write on your the paths in the URL for example [http://localhost:8080/contacts](http://localhost:8080/contacts) and see the results in JSON format with different software such as :
- Postman
- Insomnia REST Client
- Paw


**You can also see the Json for the **GET** method in the browse with JsonViewer for a better interface**
